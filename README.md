# Omlox Hub Go Client Library

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://us.profinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/omlox-tech.png">

An [Omlox](https://omlox.com/) Hub™ compatible Go client library and CLI tool.

Omlox is an open standard for precise real-time indoor localization systems.
It specifies open interfaces for an interoperable localization system that enable industry to use a single infrastructure with different applications from different providers.

> [!WARNING]  
> This library is currently being developed. Please try it out and give us feedback! Please do not use it in production or use at your own risk.

## Installation

```sh
go get -u github.com/wavecomtech/omlox-client-go
```

> [!NOTE]  
> For the CLI installation, follow the documentation at [./docs/omlox-cli.md](/docs/omlox-cli.md).

## Examples

### Getting Started

Here is a simple example of using the library to query the trackables in the hub.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/wavecomtech/omlox-client-go/omlox"
)

func main() {
    client, err := omlox.New("https://localhost:7081/v2")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    trackables, err := client.Trackables.List(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    log.Println("trackables retrieved:", trackables)
}
```

### Websockets

#### Subscription

```go
// Dials a Omlox Hub websocket interface, subscribes to
// the location_updates topic and listens to new
// location messages.

ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
defer cancel()

client, err := omlox.Connect(ctx, "localhost:7081/v2")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer client.Close()

sub, err := client.Subscribe(ctx, omlox.TopicLocationUpdates)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

for location := range omlox.ReceiveAs[omlox.Location](sub) {
    _ = location // handle location update
}
```

### Error Handling

Errors are returned when Omlox Hub responds with an HTTP status code outside of the 200 to 399 range.
If a request fails due to a network error, a different error message will be returned.

In `go>=1.13` you can use the new [errors.As](https://pkg.go.dev/errors#As) method:

```go
trackables, err := client.Trackables.List(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    var e *omlox.Error
    if errors.As(err, &e) && e.Code == http.StatusNotFound {
        // special handling for 404 errors
    }
}
```

For older go versions, you can also do type assertions:

```go
trackables, err := client.Trackables.List(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    if e, ok := err.(*omlox.Error); ok && e.Code == http.StatusNotFound {
        // special handling for 404 errors
    }
}
```

## Status

This library is coded from scratch to match the specification of Omlox Hub API.
We plan to auto-generate most of it, but the OpenAPI spec is currently invalid due to some technical decisions in the spec.
For the meantime, this library will continue to be coded from scratch.

An older iteration of this library is currently being used internally in Wavecom Technologies.
We plan to migrate to the open source version earlier next year.
The CLI is currently used by the RTLS team as a support tool for our internal Omlox Hub instance.

Following is the current checklist of the implemented schemas and API methods.

### Schemas

> [!WARNING]  
> The provided schemas are prone to change.
> Optional fields with default values have been the most challenging thing to translate well in to Go.
> We are trying different options and see which feels better.

### Code of conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development

> [!NOTE]  
> **For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).**

<details><summary><i>Installing Nix and direnv</i></summary><br>

**Note: These are instructions that _SHOULD_ work in most cases. Consult the links above for the official instructions for your OS.**

Install Nix:

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

Consult the [installation instructions](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) to install direnv using your package manager.

On MacOS:

```sh
brew install direnv
```

Install from binary builds:

```sh
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash
```

The last step is to configure your shell to use direnv. For example for bash, add the following lines at the end of your `~/.bashrc`:

    eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"

**Then restart the shell.**

For other shells, see [https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

**MacOS specific instructions**

Nix may stop working after a MacOS upgrade. If it does, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/3616#issuecomment-662858874).

</details>

Otherwise, you can install the required dependencies with Go itself.

Be sure to use Go `>=` to the one defined in `go.mod` and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`, so you can run installed go binaries. You can see how to do that at [setup-your-shell-to-run-go-installed-binaries](./docs/omlox-cli.md#setup-your-shell-to-run-go-installed-binaries).

Install development dependencies:

```console
go install github.com/mailru/easyjson/...@latest
go install github.com/hashicorp/copywrite@latest
```

You should be good to go!
